        <div id="intro">
          <p>Basketball is a game of endurance, precision, agility, and speed. 
            It takes years of dedication and hard work to become a professional 
            athlete. For basketball however, it can take a little more than just that.
            Out of the four major professional sports leagues, the NBA is the only league
            where the players can be spotted at any public venue, simply because of their height.
            This page is dedicated to exploring the significance of a player's genetic makeup in their
            ability to make it to the NBA and how it has impacted the game of basketball over the years.
